# Real-Time-Facial-Key-Points-detection
h4>Each predicted keypoint is specified by an (x,y) real-valued pair in the space of pixel indices. There are 15 keypoints, which represent the following elements of the face:

left_eye_center, right_eye_center, left_eye_inner_corner, left_eye_outer_corner, right_eye_inner_corner, right_eye_outer_corner, left_eyebrow_inner_end, left_eyebrow_outer_end, right_eyebrow_inner_end, right_eyebrow_outer_end, nose_tip, mouth_left_corner, mouth_right_corner, mouth_center_top_lip, mouth_center_bottom_lip</h4>


<h4>This reporsitory contains a stand alone python script which can be executed from command line and initiates webcam to detect facial key points. The result may differ with different lightingcondition. please checkout requirement.txt and runtime.txt </h4>
<h4>The Model has been trained using Facial Key points detection kaggle dataset</h4>
